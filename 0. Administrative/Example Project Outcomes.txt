In our final product, we aim to produce a custom system that continually develops a linear regression model to predict future liquor sales based on historical data. This model shall use a subset of the features specified in the feature engineering section. The linear regression modeling program shall allow the client to enter historical transaction data from the client’s storefronts. It will estimate model parameters and validate results via a mathematically rigorous process and use them to project monthly sales predictions for storefronts, with a predetermined and reasonable standard of accuracy and precision. 

The presentation of our findings will be characterized by visually informative, professionally formatted outputs, including charts, tables, and succinct summaries, ensuring accessibility to a wide range of stakeholders, from executives to the analytical team. To provide a broader context for our results, we will incorporate relevant references, enabling the client’s organization to make decisions rooted in data-backed insights. This will allow the client to accurately prepare to gracefully meet the expectations of the greater public and boost efficiency.
